# Zendesk_Workflow
Leveled up my Zendesk skills by creating and tackling 12 mock tickets
<br>
Today, I explored Zendesk by creating and resolving 12 sample tickets, simulating real-world IT support scenarios. I played the role of an agent, addressing customer issues via call, chat, and email. It was a valuable experience, and I gained hands-on knowledge of Zendesk's workflow and CRM capabilities. I'm building confidence in using the platform and look forward to further development.
